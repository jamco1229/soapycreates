Sophie Banks is a Norwich-based ceramic artist known for earthy glazes and
playful forms. Her practice focuses on functional pieces with character, made
slowly and meant to be used every day.

Each mug is thrown, trimmed, and glazed by hand in small batches, embracing
variation as part of the work.
